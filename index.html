  ======================= -->
  <section id="about">
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <p>
        I'm a mechatronics engineer with a strong preference for software-driven solutions.
        I enjoy designing systems where code, data, and hardware meet, with a focus on
        practicality, performance, and real-world impact.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        I'm especially interested in automation, data analysis, and engineering tools that
        improve decision-making. I tend to learn by building, iterating, and refining —
        favoring clean logic over unnecessary complexity.
