# Personal Portfolio – Alexvillhen

A personal portfolio website built with **vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, designed to function as both a **living CV** and a showcase of how I think about systems, UI behavior, and engineering problems.

This site is intentionally lightweight, framework-free, and fully maintainable.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

* **HTML5** – semantic structure
* **CSS3** – custom properties, grid, transitions
* **JavaScript (ES6)** – state-driven UI behavior

## 🧠 Design Philosophy

This portfolio was built with the following principles:

* **Clarity over decoration**
* **Intentional interactions** (no generic UI patterns)
* **Systems thinking** applied to frontend behavior
* **Real projects > buzzwords**

The interactive skills section behaves more like an *inspector panel* than a typical accordion, reflecting how I approach engineering problems.

Built with intent and curiosity.
